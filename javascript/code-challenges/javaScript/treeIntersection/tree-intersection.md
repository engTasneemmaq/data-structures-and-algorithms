## Tree Intersection


## Challenge Summary
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.


## Approach & Efficiency
1. Declare a function for tree intersection
2. declare 2 new arrays for the values from the two trees
3. declare a new empty array for the common values
4. loop through arr1
5. check if there are common values and push them to the new array
6. return the new array
